Unit tests root directory for the High Performance Conputing Data Management HPCDM REST APIs.

These unit tests are organized according to the DICE cross platform unit testing framework. 

To download and install DICE, please follow the documentation at:
http://www.ece.umd.edu/DSPCAD/projects/dice/dice.htm

-Configuration:
  I-Edit four configuration files in the ./utils subdirectory:
    1- ./utils/config
        Add you username after the option "-u <username>[:password]"
        Note: Do not check in the config file in the repository with your NCI password.
        For that, the config file is checked in as a dynamic link.
    2- ./utils/globus-config
        Add you username after the option "-u <username>[:password]"
        Note: Do not check in the globus-config file in the repository with your GlobusID password.
        For that, the globus-config file is checked in as a dynamic link.
    3. ./utils/server
        Edit the server name and port number for the server to be tested.
    4. ./utils/test-configuration
        Edit the shared globus endpoint. 

  II- Create a globus shared endpoint called HPC_DM_TEST and share it with the system admin. Add a test.txt empty file to this Globus endpoint:
        "endpoint": "HPC_DM_TEST",
        "path": "test.txt"

  III- Add a dice-download empty folder to this  Globus endpoint:
        "endpoint": "HPC_DM_TEST",
        "path": "/dice-download/"
  
  IV- Define the environment variable HPC_DM_TEST and let it point to the directory where this README.txt is located.
        For example:
           $export HPC_DM_TEST=/path/to/this/README.txt/

  V- To run test-hpc-client units tests, please follow the setup steps shown in ./test-hpc-client/README.txt 

  VI- The user who will run the test should be part of a dummy DOC with the hierarchy specified in the appendix.

-Execution:
  Every leaf directory includes two scripts: makeme and runme.
  To run the unit tests:
  - For an indiviual leaf Individual Test Subdirectory (ITS) in a leaf folder, run the makeme followed by the runme scripts from the leaf directory.
    The stdout should match the contents of the "correct-output.txt" file, and the stderr should match the contents of the "expected-errors.txt" file.
    Note that these two files can be empty which is still a correct behavior.
  - Use the DICE "dxtest" command from any diretory in the test hierarchy to run all the leaves ITSs that are under this directory. 
    This will give a summary for the test resutls.

For more information about the ITS, check the DICE documentation.


Appendix:
Dummy DOC policies:
{
      "DOC": [
        "DUMMY"
      ],
      "collectionType": "Project",
      "isDataObjectContainer": false,
      "subCollections": [
        {
          "collectionType": "Dataset",
          "isDataObjectContainer": true
        },
        {
          "collectionType": "Folder",
          "isDataObjectContainer": true
        }
 
      ]
}
